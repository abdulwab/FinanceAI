## 5. Database Access Strategy

### 5.1 Database Schema

The schema is defined using both Prisma (for Next.js) and SQLAlchemy models (for FastAPI). Key tables include:

- `users`: Manages user identity, authentication, and profile details
- `agents`: Stores the main agent configuration with userId foreign key
- `tools`: Tools associated with an agent
- `handoffs`: Handoff targets associated with an agent 
- `guardrails`: Input/Output guardrails associated with an agent
- `outputtypes`: Structured output definitions for an agent
- `agentfiles`: Files associated with agents
- `runs`, `messages`: For logging agent execution history
- `workflows`: For managing multi-agent workflows
- `workflow_steps`: For defining the steps in a workflow
- `conversations`, `message`: For community interactions
- `notifications`: For system notifications
- `user_follows`: For tracking user relationships
- `comments`: For storing comments on agents
- `reactions`: For storing reactions on agents
- `ratings`: For storing ratings on agents
- `user_credits`: For tracking user credit balances
- `credit_transactions`: For tracking credit purchases and usage
- `payment_history`: For tracking payment information
- `file_store`: For managing uploaded files
- `vector_store`: For storing file embeddings for search
- `api_keys`: For storing provider API keys (encrypted)
- `agent_context`: For storing additional context for agents

### 5.2 Database Connection Management

#### Next.js Application
- Uses Prisma ORM for database access
- Prisma schema defines all tables and relationships
- Connection pool managed by Prisma client

#### Python FastAPI Application
- Uses SQLAlchemy ORM for database access
- Models defined to mirror Prisma schema
- Independent connection pool with appropriate sizing

### 5.3 Schema Management

- **Schema Source of Truth**: The Prisma schema in the Next.js project is the source of truth
- **Schema Migration**: Migrations are managed through Prisma and applied from the Next.js app
- **Schema Sync**: Python models are kept in sync with the Prisma schema through a defined process

## 6. Database Synchronization Process

### 6.1 Creating New Models/Tables

1. Define the model in the Prisma schema
2. Generate and run migrations using Prisma
3. Manually create the corresponding SQLAlchemy model in the Python backend
4. Test compatibility between both applications

### 6.2 Updating Existing Models/Tables

1. Update the Prisma schema
2. Generate and run migrations using Prisma
3. Manually update the corresponding SQLAlchemy model in Python
4. Test for compatibility and data integrity

### 6.3 Manual Synchronization Process

#### 6.3.1 Model Definition Template Consistency

Maintain a consistent modeling pattern between Prisma and SQLAlchemy:

```python
# SQLAlchemy template for models in Python backend
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Boolean, ForeignKey, DateTime, Float, JSON, Table
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = "users"
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    email = Column(String, unique=True, nullable=False)
    name = Column(String)
    created_at = Column(DateTime, nullable=False)
    updated_at = Column(DateTime, nullable=False)
    
    # Define relationships
    agents = relationship("Agent", back_populates="user")
```

```typescript
// Prisma model in schema.prisma for Next.js frontend
model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String?
  createdAt DateTime @default(now()) @map("created_at")
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt @map("updated_at")
  
  // Define relationships
  agents    Agent[]
}
```

#### 6.3.2 Type Mapping Guide

Establish a consistent mapping of types between Prisma and SQLAlchemy:

| Prisma Type | SQLAlchemy Type | Notes |
|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| Int         | Integer         |       |
| String      | String          | Consider length limitations |
| Boolean     | Boolean         |       |
| DateTime    | DateTime        | Time zone handling may differ |
| Float       | Float           |       |
| Json        | JSON            |       |
| Bytes       | LargeBinary     |       |
| Decimal     | Numeric         | Precision and scale need careful mapping |

#### 6.3.3 Relationship Handling Guidelines

For each relationship type:

1. **One-to-Many**:
   - In Prisma: Define both sides using arrays on "many" side
   - In SQLAlchemy: Use relationship() with back_populates

2. **Many-to-Many**:
   - In Prisma: Use implicit join tables
   - In SQLAlchemy: Create explicit association tables

3. **One-to-One**:
   - In Prisma: Use optional or required references
   - In SQLAlchemy: Use uselist=False in relationship()

#### 6.3.4 Synchronization Checklist

For each schema change:

1. Document the change in a shared document
2. Update Prisma schema
3. Generate and run Prisma migrations
4. Manually update SQLAlchemy models based on the mapping guide
5. Perform unit tests on both ORM implementations
6. Update version tracking in database

#### 6.3.5 Schema Version Tracking

Track schema versions explicitly in the database:

```sql
CREATE TABLE schema_version (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    version VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    applied_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    is_current BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
);
```

Check version compatibility in application middleware to ensure both applications run against a compatible schema version.

### 16.2 Multi-Agent Orchestration

Based on the OpenAI Agents SDK, there are two main approaches to orchestrating multiple agents:

#### 16.2.1 Orchestrating via LLM

In this approach, the LLM itself makes decisions about which agents to use through handoffs. The platform will support:

- Creating specialized agents for different domains:
  ```python
  history_tutor_agent = Agent(
      name="History Tutor",
      handoff_description="Specialist agent for historical questions",
      instructions="You provide assistance with historical queries. Explain important events and context clearly."
  )
  
  math_tutor_agent = Agent(
      name="Math Tutor",
      handoff_description="Specialist agent for math questions",
      instructions="You provide help with math problems. Explain your reasoning at each step and include examples"
  )
  
  # Triage agent that delegates to specialist agents
  triage_agent = Agent(
      name="Triage Agent",
      instructions="You determine which agent to use based on the user's question",
      handoffs=[history_tutor_agent, math_tutor_agent]
  )
  ```

- Best practices for LLM orchestration:
  1. Invest in good prompts with clear instructions about available tools and parameters
  2. Implement monitoring and iteration based on observed issues
  3. Enable agent self-improvement through introspection and feedback loops
  4. Create specialized agents focused on specific tasks rather than general-purpose agents
  5. Implement evaluation systems to track and improve agent performance

#### 16.2.2 Orchestrating via Code

For more deterministic and predictable behavior, the platform will support code-based orchestration:

- Using structured outputs to make routing decisions:
  ```python
  class ClassificationOutput(BaseModel):
      category: Literal["math", "history", "science"]
      confidence: float
  
  classifier_agent = Agent(
      name="Classifier",
      instructions="Classify the user question into the appropriate category",
      output_type=ClassificationOutput
  )
  
  async def route_question(question):
      result = await Runner.run(classifier_agent, question)
      classification = result.final_output_as(ClassificationOutput)
      
      if classification.category == "math":
          return await Runner.run(math_agent, question)
      elif classification.category == "history":
          return await Runner.run(history_agent, question)
      else:
          return await Runner.run(science_agent, question)
  ```

- Chaining agents sequentially:
  ```python
  async def blog_writing_workflow(topic):
      # Step 1: Research
      research_result = await Runner.run(research_agent, f"Research about {topic}")
      
      # Step 2: Create outline
      outline_result = await Runner.run(outline_agent, f"Create outline based on:\n{research_result.final_output}")
      
      # Step 3: Write draft
      draft_result = await Runner.run(writing_agent, f"Write based on outline:\n{outline_result.final_output}")
      
      # Step 4: Edit and improve
      final_result = await Runner.run(editing_agent, f"Edit and improve:\n{draft_result.final_output}")
      
      return final_result.final_output
  ```

- Implementing feedback loops:
  ```python
  async def iterative_improvement(task):
      current_output = await Runner.run(worker_agent, task)
      
      for _ in range(3):  # Maximum 3 iterations
          review_result = await Runner.run(
              reviewer_agent, 
              f"Review this output:\n{current_output.final_output}"
          )
          
          if "PASS" in review_result.final_output:
              break
              
          current_output = await Runner.run(
              worker_agent,
              f"Improve based on feedback:\nOriginal output: {current_output.final_output}\nFeedback: {review_result.final_output}"
          )
      
      return current_output.final_output
  ```

- Running agents in parallel:
  ```python
  async def parallel_processing(task):
      results = await asyncio.gather(
          Runner.run(agent1, task),
          Runner.run(agent2, task),
          Runner.run(agent3, task)
      )
      
      # Combine or select from results
      return "\n".join([r.final_output for r in results])
  ```

#### 16.2.3 Error Handling for Multi-Agent Workflows

Implement explicit error handling for agent handoffs and execution:

```python
async def safe_agent_run(agent, input_text, max_retries=3):
    retries = 0
    while retries < max_retries:
        try:
            result = await Runner.run(agent, input_text)
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            retries += 1
            if retries >= max_retries:
                # Log the failure and fall back to a default agent
                logger.error(f"Agent {agent.name} failed after {max_retries} attempts: {str(e)}")
                return await Runner.run(fallback_agent, input_text)
            # Add exponential backoff if appropriate
            await asyncio.sleep(2 ** retries)
```

#### 16.2.4 State Management Between Agents

Implement explicit state management for sharing context between agents:

```python
async def workflow_with_shared_context(input_text):
    # Initialize shared context
    context = {
        "original_query": input_text,
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "intermediate_results": {}
    }
    
    # First agent uses and updates context
    result1 = await Runner.run(
        first_agent, 
        input_text,
        context=context
    )
    
    # Update shared context with results from first agent
    context["intermediate_results"]["first_agent"] = result1.final_output
    
    # Second agent receives the updated context
    result2 = await Runner.run(
        second_agent,
        "Continue processing with additional context",
        context=context
    )
    
    return result2.final_output
```

### 16.3 Tool Integration

Based on the OpenAI Agents SDK documentation, implement the following tool categories:

#### 16.3.1 Prebuilt Hosted Tools

The platform will integrate the prebuilt hosted tools from the SDK:

```python
from agents import Agent, WebSearchTool, FileSearchTool, ComputerTool

# Research agent with prebuilt tools
research_agent = Agent(
    name="Research Assistant",
    instructions="You help with research by searching the web and relevant files",
    tools=[
        WebSearchTool(),  # For internet searches
        FileSearchTool(   # For searching uploaded documents
            max_num_results=3,
            vector_store_ids=["user_documents"],
        ),
        ComputerTool()    # For computer interaction (with appropriate security)
    ]
)
```

#### 16.3.2 Custom Function Tools

Enable users to create custom function tools with automatic schema generation:

```python
# Simple function tool example
def weather_tool(location: str) -> str:
    """Get the current weather for a location."""
    # Implementation would call a weather API
    return f"Weather in {location} is sunny, 72°F"

# Function tool with more complex return type
from pydantic import BaseModel

class StockInfo(BaseModel):
    symbol: str
    price: float
    change: float
    volume: int

def stock_lookup(symbol: str) -> StockInfo:
    """Get current stock information."""
    # Implementation would call a financial API
    return StockInfo(
        symbol=symbol,
        price=150.25,
        change=2.5,
        volume=1000000
    )

# Agent with custom function tools
financial_agent = Agent(
    name="Financial Advisor",
    instructions="You provide financial advice and information",
    tools=[stock_lookup, weather_tool]
)
```

#### 16.3.3 Agents as Tools

Support using agents directly as tools for other agents:

```python
calculator_agent = Agent(
    name="Calculator",
    instructions="You perform precise calculations"
)

research_agent = Agent(
    name="Research Agent",
    instructions="You research topics and provide information",
    tools=[calculator_agent]  # Using agent as a tool
)
```

#### 16.3.4 Tool Security Implementation

For tools with security implications (especially ComputerTool):

```python
# Implement security sandbox for ComputerTool
from agents import ComputerTool

secure_computer_tool = ComputerTool(
    # Set strict limitations
    allowed_commands=["ls", "cat", "find"],  # Only allow specific commands
    blocked_paths=["/etc", "/usr", "/home"],  # Block sensitive directories
    max_execution_time=5,                     # Set execution timeout
    read_only=True                            # Prevent file modifications
)

# Agent with secure computer tool
system_agent = Agent(
    name="System Assistant",
    instructions="You help with basic system operations within strict security boundaries",
    tools=[secure_computer_tool]
)
```

#### 16.3.5 Vector Store Integration for FileSearchTool
