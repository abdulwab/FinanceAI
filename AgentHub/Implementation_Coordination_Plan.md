- UI for agent creation and configuration
- Frontend routing and navigation
- Real-time notifications
- Analytics dashboards and visualizations

### Python FastAPI Backend Responsibilities
- Agent creation and execution
- OpenAI Agents SDK integration
- Multi-provider model integration
- Tool implementation and management
- File processing and vector store management
- Agent evaluation and testing
- Multi-agent workflow execution
- Performance monitoring for agents
- API-based access to agent functionality

## Shared Resources

### Database

- **Tables Managed by Next.js**:
  - users
  - profiles
  - social_connections
  - notifications

- **Tables Managed by FastAPI**:
  - agents
  - agent_runs
  - tools
  - handoffs
  - workflows
  - workflow_runs
  - file_metadata
  - vector_indices
  
- **Tables Accessed by Both**:
  - user_credits (Next.js for display, FastAPI for consumption)
  - agent_metadata (Next.js for display, FastAPI for execution)

### Authentication
- **Auth System**: JWT-based authentication implemented in Next.js

## Development Coordination

### API Contract Development
1. **Design Phase**:
   - Create OpenAPI specification for all endpoints
   - Review API design with both frontend and backend teams
   - Establish versioning strategy
   - Document expected behavior for all endpoints

2. **Implementation Phase**:
   - Backend team implements API endpoints according to spec
   - Frontend team creates API client based on spec
   - Weekly review meetings to address any API issues

3. **Testing Phase**:
   - Create shared integration tests
   - Implement automated API validation
   - Regular contract testing to prevent drift

### Shared Database Management
1. **Schema Development**:
   - Frontend team creates Prisma schema changes
   - Backend team implements corresponding SQLAlchemy models
   - Weekly schema review meetings
   - Version control for all schema changes

2. **Migration Strategy**:
   - Prisma migrations run first
   - Backend synchronizes with latest schema
   - Automated testing of database compatibility
   - Rollback procedures for failed migrations

3. **Data Access Patterns**:
   - Document which service owns which data
   - Define access patterns for shared tables
   - Create data validation rules

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Local Development**:
  - Docker Compose for running all services locally
  - Shared database instance
  - Environment variable management system
  - Mocked services where appropriate

- **Integration Environment**:
  - Automated deployment from feature branches
  - Shared database with test data
  - Full integration testing suite
  - Performance testing infrastructure

### Staging Environment
- **Deployment Process**:
  - Automated deployment from staging branch
  - Production-like environment
  - Complete data flow testing
  - Load testing with production-like volumes

- **Testing Focus**:
  - End-to-end feature validation
  - UI/UX testing
  - Performance validation
  - Security testing

### Production Environment
- **Deployment Strategy**:
  - Blue-green deployment for zero downtime
  - Canary releases for high-risk changes
  - Automated rollback capabilities
  - Health monitoring and alerting

- **Scaling Approach**:
  - Frontend scaled based on user traffic
  - Backend scaled based on agent execution load
