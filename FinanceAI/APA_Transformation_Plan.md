# Transforming FinanceAI into Agentic Process Automation (APA)

This document outlines how to transform the FinanceAI MVP from a traditional workflow automation system with AI components into a comprehensive Agentic Process Automation (APA) system.

## What is Agentic Process Automation (APA)?

Agentic Process Automation (APA) represents an evolution beyond traditional workflow automation by incorporating:

1. **Autonomous Agents**: Software entities that can make decisions and take actions without constant human intervention.
2. **Adaptive Workflows**: Processes that can adjust based on context, exceptions, and learning from past experiences.
3. **Intelligent Orchestration**: Coordination of multiple agents working together to accomplish complex tasks.
4. **Continuous Learning**: Improvement over time through feedback loops and pattern recognition.
